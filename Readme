The situation you described involves the creation and termination of EC2 instances where the associated EBS volumes were not automatically deleted after the instances were terminated. Over time, this led to a large number of unattached (orphaned) EBS volumes, which continued to incur storage costs, causing unexpected charges.

### **Explanation of What Happened:**

1. **Instance Creation and Termination:**
   - **Auto Scaling:** When the Auto Scaling group scaled up, it created new EC2 instances based on the launch template. Each instance had at least one EBS volume attached (usually the root volume).
   - **Termination:** When the Auto Scaling group scaled down, instances were terminated. However, the EBS volumes associated with these instances were not deleted because the "Delete on Termination" option was not enabled in the launch template.

2. **Accumulation of Unattached EBS Volumes:**
   - Each time an instance was terminated without the "Delete on Termination" option enabled, the EBS volumes remained in your AWS account, unattached to any instance but still incurring storage costs.
   - Over time, as more instances were launched and terminated, the number of orphaned EBS volumes increased, leading to significant costs.

### **Why Did This Happen?**

The root cause is a configuration oversight in the launch template. The "Delete on Termination" option for the EBS volumes was not enabled. This oversight is common when the focus is on launching and scaling instances, and the storage cleanup aspect is overlooked.

### **Impact:**
- **Financial Impact:** The cost impact can be substantial, especially if many instances were launched and terminated frequently. EBS volumes are charged based on the amount of storage provisioned, so a large number of unattached volumes could lead to high costs.
- **Operational Impact:** Managing and cleaning up these orphaned volumes manually can be time-consuming and disruptive to regular operations.

### **Mitigation and Prevention:**

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - **Identify and Delete Orphaned Volumes:** Use the AWS Console or CLI to list all unattached EBS volumes and delete those that are not needed.
   - **Review Billing:** Analyze your AWS billing to understand the cost impact and identify any other potential cost anomalies.

2. **Preventative Measures:**
   - **Enable "Delete on Termination":** Update the launch template to ensure that the "Delete on Termination" option is enabled for all EBS volumes.
   - **Monitor Orphaned Volumes:** Set up alerts or scripts to periodically check for unattached EBS volumes and review them for deletion.
   - **Use AWS Config Rules:** Implement AWS Config rules to enforce that EBS volumes should be deleted upon instance termination unless explicitly required otherwise.

### 1. **Incident Overview**
   - **Incident Description:**  
     During a review of AWS billing, it was discovered that significant costs were incurred due to a large number of unattached EBS volumes. These volumes were created by EC2 instances launched via an Auto Scaling group, and were not deleted when the instances were terminated.

   - **Date of Incident:**  
     [Date Range of the Issue]

   - **Impact:**  
     Financial impact due to ongoing charges for unattached EBS volumes. Operational time spent on identifying and manually deleting orphaned volumes.

### 2. **Root Cause**
   - **Technical Root Cause:**  
     The launch template used by the Auto Scaling group did not have the "Delete on Termination" option enabled for the EBS volumes. As a result, when instances were terminated, their associated EBS volumes were not automatically deleted, leading to an accumulation of unattached volumes.

### 3. **Contributing Factors**
   - The "Delete on Termination" option was not reviewed or enabled during the creation of the launch template.
   - Lack of monitoring or alerts for unattached EBS volumes.

### 4. **Resolution and Corrective Actions**
   - **Immediate Resolution:**  
     All unattached EBS volumes were identified and deleted to stop further charges.
   - **Corrective Actions:**
     1. The launch template was updated to ensure the "Delete on Termination" option is enabled for EBS volumes.
     2. Implemented an automated monitoring script to detect and report unattached EBS volumes.
     3. Established a periodic review of Auto Scaling configurations to ensure best practices are followed.

### 5. **Preventative Measures**
   - **Policy Update:**  
     Update internal policies to mandate that all new launch templates have the "Delete on Termination" option enabled by default.
   - **Training:**  
     Conduct a training session for the team on best practices for configuring EC2 instances and managing EBS volumes.
   - **AWS Config Rule:**  
     Implement an AWS Config rule to enforce that EBS volumes associated with EC2 instances are deleted upon termination unless explicitly required otherwise.

### 6. **Lessons Learned**
   - Importance of thoroughly reviewing launch templates for all options, particularly those with cost implications.
   - Need for proactive monitoring of cloud resources to prevent similar incidents.

### 7. **Conclusion**
   - The issue has been resolved, and steps have been taken to prevent recurrence. This incident highlights the importance of careful configuration management and ongoing resource monitoring.
