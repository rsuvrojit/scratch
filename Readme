Tableau Einstein Copilot: Key Features and How to Use Them

1. Building a Sample Visualization

Tableau's Einstein Copilot offers AI-driven assistance to help you build visualizations based on your data. Here’s how you can use it to create a sample visualization:

Step 1: Upload your dataset or connect to a data source in Tableau.

Step 2: In the toolbar, you’ll find the Einstein Copilot icon. Click on it and type a command, such as "Show sales trends over the last year."

Step 3: Einstein will analyze your data and suggest a visualization (e.g., a line chart for trends). You can confirm or adjust the type of visualization.

Step 4: The Copilot will automatically place the appropriate fields onto rows and columns, creating your chart.

Step 5: You can then further customize the visualization by dragging and dropping fields or making design adjustments as needed.


2. Filtering, Sorting, and Grouping Data

Einstein Copilot simplifies the process of filtering, sorting, and grouping data:

Filtering: Use Copilot commands like "Show only data from Q1 2024" or "Filter by country = 'United States.'" Einstein will create the filter for you and apply it to the visualization.

Sorting: You can ask Einstein to sort data with commands such as "Sort the sales data by highest to lowest revenue." Einstein will update the view accordingly.

Grouping: If you need to group data, simply instruct Einstein to "Group sales data by region." It will organize the data and update the visualization to reflect these groupings.


3. Creating a Calculated Field

Creating calculated fields with Einstein Copilot involves using natural language queries to define new metrics:

Step 1: Open the Einstein Copilot and type a request like "Create a calculated field for profit margin as (Profit / Sales)."

Step 2: Einstein will recognize the calculation, create the new field, and make it available in your dataset.

Step 3: You can then drag the calculated field onto your visualization for further analysis or to enhance your dashboard.


Einstein Copilot’s natural language capabilities make it easier to perform these tasks without needing to navigate through complex menus, enabling a more streamlined experience for both beginners and advanced users alike.
