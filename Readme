In Tableau, labels in a stacked bar chart are displayed based on available space within each segment of the bar. When there is limited space, Tableau automatically decides whether to display a label to avoid overlap and ensure readability. Here’s how Tableau generally decides which segments to label:

1. **Size of the Segment**:
    - **Larger Segments**: Labels are more likely to be displayed in larger segments of the bar because there is more space to accommodate the text.
    - **Smaller Segments**: Labels may not appear in smaller segments due to insufficient space for the text.

2. **Relative Size and Importance**:
    - Tableau tends to prioritize labeling segments that have more significant values (larger sales in your case) as these are often more important for analysis.
    - Smaller values may get deprioritized for labeling if they do not have enough space.

3. **Available Space and Overlap**:
    - Tableau checks for overlap with other labels and tries to avoid it. If adding a label would cause overlap or clutter, it may omit the label.

4. **Manual Adjustments**:
    - You can manually adjust the labeling settings to prioritize which segments get labeled, though there are limitations based on space.

### How to Manage Labels in a Stacked Bar Chart

1. **Adjust Label Settings**:
    - Go to the "Label" shelf.
    - Ensure "Allow labels to overlap other marks" is unchecked (though checking it might force some labels to appear, it can lead to overlap).
    - Consider reducing the font size to allow more labels to fit.

2. **Using Abbreviations or Shortened Labels**:
    - Shorten the labels if possible, to allow them to fit in smaller segments.

3. **Custom Labeling**:
    - You can create a calculated field to display labels selectively, focusing on larger or more significant segments.
    - For example:
      ```sql
      IF SUM([Sales]) > [Threshold] THEN STR(SUM([Sales])) ELSE "" END
      ```
    - Replace `[Threshold]` with a value that determines when to display the label.

4. **Use Tooltips for Detailed Information**:
    - If space is too constrained, rely on tooltips for displaying detailed information. Users can hover over segments to see the sum of sales.

5. **Reformat the Chart**:
    - If your chart is too crowded, consider splitting it into smaller charts by categories or using a different type of visualization like a treemap, which may handle numerous categories better.

### Manual Prioritization of Labels

If you need more control over which segments get labeled, consider using Tableau’s "Annotation" feature:

1. **Right-click** on the segment you want to label.
2. Select "Annotate" > "Mark".
3. Adjust the annotation box to display the desired information.

By understanding how Tableau decides which labels to display and applying these adjustments, you can better manage the appearance of labels in your stacked bar chart.
